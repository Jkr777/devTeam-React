This project is created using create-react-app tool, node.js express and mongodb.
- I used react hooks to handle the lifecycle features of a component. 
- I use redux to manage the app state.
- express for the server and to create a REST API
- mongodb for the database
- sass to create the style.
- gravatar for the profile image.
- I use email/password authentication.
- I run this project in heroku using a buildpack, --buildpack https://github.com/mars/create-react-app-buildpack.git.
